                Exercising regularly has wide-ranging physical, emotional and social health benefits. You need to exercise safely to remain healthy and injury-free. If it’s safe and painless, you’re more likely to stick to it! Safety is about using common sense, understanding basic techniques and listening to your body. <br>
            <br>
            See your doctor for a check-up before embarking on a physical activity program. Your doctor, physiotherapist or local sporting club can offer you tips about staying safe while exercising. <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Before you start, let's do some warm up steps</h3> 
            <br>
            Here are some tips to stay safe and injury-free:<br>
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                <li><strong>Be aware of your body. </strong>Think about how the particular exercise is making you feel. If something doesn’t feel right, stop immediately and seek medical advice.</li>
                <li><strong>Warm up and cool down.</strong> Try slow stretches and go through the motions of your sport or activity before starting. Cool down with slow stretching. </li>
                <li><strong>Pace yourself.</strong> Have at least one recovery day each week to rest. If you are experiencing pain, rest until the pain has gone. </li>
                <li><strong>Mix it up.</strong> Try other sports and exercises to reduce the risk of overtraining.</li>
                <li><strong>Strap or tape.</strong> If a joint is prone to injury, consider strapping or taping it before exercising. Even better, see an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist to obtain a program to strengthen the injured area and get advice on proper taping techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> You can lose around one and a half litres of fluid for every hour of exercise; so drink water before, during and after a session.</li>
                <li><strong>Be weather aware.</strong> Take it easier in hot weather and wear clothing and sunscreen to protect yourself from the elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Do it right.</strong> Try to get the technique right from the beginning, to ensure you are using your muscles correctly. </li>
                <li><strong>Check your gear.</strong> Make sure your shoes and equipment fit properly and are right for the activity. Look after your equipment and check it regularly for safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Be sensible,</strong> especially at night or in secluded areas. Take a friend or your dog, stick to well-lit areas and wear bright or light-reflective clothing so drivers can see you.</li>
            </ol>

                <br>
                <h1>Now let'start</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>First let's stretch your body</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Side Lunge Stretch</h3>
                <br>
                <img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/stretches_to_help_you_get_loose_slideshow/1800ss_science_source_rf_side_lunge_stretch.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt="side lunge stretch">
                <br><br>
                <p>Keep your upper body straight and legs apart. Then shift your weight in a slow "lunge" to the side over a bent knee (not forward, as in a typical lunge). You should feel a stretch along the inner thigh of the opposite leg, which should be straight as you push your weight to the bent-knee side. Try to hold it for 20 to 30 seconds on each side.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Cobra Stretch</h3>
                <br>
                <img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/stretches_to_help_you_get_loose_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_cobra_pose.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt="cobra pose">
                <br><br>
                <p>It stretches your stomach and back muscles. Lie on your belly with your hands facing forward flat on the floor, directly under your shoulders. Stretch your legs out behind you and point your toes. As you exhale, lift your chest up and push your hips into the floor. Take care not to extend your arms so far that you lift your hips up. Hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Standing Hip Flexor Stretch</h3>
                <br>
                <img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/stretches_to_help_you_get_loose_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_standing_hip_flexor_stretch.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt="standing hip flexor stretch">
                <br><br>
                <p>Your hip flexors -- muscles that help you lift your knees and bend your waist -- can get tight if you're a runner or you sit for long periods. Drop one leg back, keeping it straight or slightly bent. Try to keep your torso upright and your spine straight. Drop your tailbone down toward the floor and tuck your butt forward until you feel the stretch on the inside thigh of your rear leg. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds and then switch legs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Standing Hamstring Stretch</h3>
                <br>
                <img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/stretches_to_help_you_get_loose_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_standing_hamstring_stretch.jpg?resize=650px:*" alt="standing hamstring stretch">
                <br><br>
                <p>In a standing position, find something to hold for balance. Put one straightened leg up on a step or a block. Bend slightly (not beyond your toes) with the opposite knee until you feel a gentle stretch at the back of the thigh of the raised leg. Bend slightly forward from your hips if you need more stretch. Move slowly and evenly, without bouncing. Hold it for 20 to 30 seconds and switch legs.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Triceps Stretch</h3>

                <br><br>
                <div><ul><li>Kneel, sit, or stand tall with feet hip-width apart, arms extended overhead.</li><li>Bend your right elbow and reach your right hand to touch the top middle of your back.</li><li>Reach your left hand overhead and grasp just below your right elbow.</li><li>Gently pull your right elbow down and toward your head.</li><li>Switch arms and repeat.</li></ul><p><em>Stretches neck, shoulders, back, triceps</em></p></div>
